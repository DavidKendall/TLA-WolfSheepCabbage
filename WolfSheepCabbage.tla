(*
 * A solution to the problem can be found with the model above by
 * checking the invariant ~Goal and examining the error trace.
 * Alternatively, the behaviour of the model can be less constrained
 * by removing EverythingSafe(location') from CrossAlone and CrossWith(p)
 * and checking the temporal property ([]EverythingSafe(location)) => ([]~Goal)
 *)
